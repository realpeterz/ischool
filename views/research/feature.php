<p>Health is one of the most rapidly growing areas of research in the iSchool 
movement because of its social importance, the significant role of information 
and information technology in health care, and the intertwined social, 
organizational, medical, and technical issues associated with solving health 
care problems.  With the aging population and the epidemic of obesity in the 
United States, there is rapidly increasing attention on health 
issues.  Approximately one third of the faculty in the UT iSchool are working on 
issues of health information or health informatics.  A number of our faculty 
members are working on a single disease, diabetes, which is the most prevalent 
and costly chronic illness in America.  While the focus of much of the faculty's 
research on health targets the United States, many of these projects have 
obvious applications to health issues in other countries. Here is a survey of 
the work being carried out in the UT School of Information, as of fall 2009, on 
health information and health informatics.</p>

 

<h2>Gary Geisler</h2>
<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=90">Gary Geisler</a> is working with colleagues at Harvard Medical School and 
Massachusetts General Hospital on a National Institutes of Health/National 
Library of Medicine funded grant project called eMicrobes: A Digital Library for 
Learning Infectious Diseases. The three-year project will develop eMicrobes to 
be an extensive and easily searchable digital library of interactive case 
studies and images that will enable medical students, practicing physicians, and 
other healthcare workers to more easily learn and find information about 
infectious diseases. Important goals of the project include dynamically 
integrating relevant information from on-line biomedical sources such as PubMed 
to enrich case information; to provide options to store and access eMicrobes 
resources locally when not connected to the Internet, such as in rural settings 
and resource-scarce countries; and to support access from mobile devices.</p>

 

<h2>Luis Francisco-Revilla</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=91">Luis Francisco-Revilla</a>'s work in health informatics has focused on studying 
how new technological platforms and novel visualization methods can help improve 
the health of target populations. In particular, he works on studying and 
devising socio-technical solutions that help in discovering temporal and 
geo-spatial relationships between health aspects and environmental factors, and 
in understanding the effect of specific policies on health aspects. As a member 
of the Technical Advisory Committee Luis Francisco-Revilla has been 
collaborating with Children's Optimal Health to "visual images to inform policy, 
improve operations, promote research, and mobilize the community to better the 
lives of our children and youth". Francisco-Revilla has collaborated with Sandia
National Laboratories in the development of a diabetes model and simulator aimed 
at informing health policy makers about the possible effects of alternative 
policies. This collaboration also studies how to use these technologies as an 
intervention mechanism for helping high-risk populations prevent the development 
of diabetes.</p>

 

<h2>Yan Zhang</h2>
<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=150">Yan Zhang</a>'s research on health information focuses on people's general health 
information needs, health information searching behavior in the web environment, 
and the usability of web-based consumer health information systems. In the past, 
she has worked on a personal health records (PHRs) project, exploring people's 
needs and concerns of digital PHRs and the effects of different information 
presentation formats on people's perceptions of their health conditions. She has 
worked with an industry partner on improving the usability of their web-based 
service providing individualized recommendations for vitamin, supplements, and 
shopping guidelines for customers. She has also worked on a project 
investigating how people judge relationships between medical concepts and 
whether such end user judgments can improve the performance of a medical concept 
extraction and association program. In her doctoral dissertation, she explored 
the change and development of people's mental representations of MedlinePlus, a 
consumer health website created and maintained by the National Library of 
Medicine, during a search session. Continuing on this line of research, she is 
currently looking at the relationship between subjects' mental representations 
and their information searching behavior in MedlinePlus. Meanwhile she is 
working on a project to identify the characteristics of people's health 
information needs as manifested by the questions that they submit to social 
questions and answers websites and how consumer health information systems can 
be designed to better support such needs.</p>

 

<h2>William Aspray</h2>
<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=128">William Aspray</a>'s work in health informatics has focused on sociotechnical 
aspects of chronic disease.  Together with Barbara Hayes of Indiana University, 
he is editing <em>Health Informatics: A Patient-Centered Approach to Diabetes</em> (MIT 
Press, to appear 2010).  He has written for this volume, also with Hayes, a long 
essay on "The Informatics of Diabetes: A Research Agenda for the Socially and 
Institutionally Sensitive Use of Information Technology to Improve 
Healthcare."  The book includes articles by faculty at a number of the iSchools 
(Florida State, Georgia Tech, Indiana, Michigan, Northeastern, Texas, and 
Washington) and covers such topics as ubiquitous computing, avatars as health 
coaches, serious gaming, and electronic health records.</p>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=42">Glynn Harmon</a>'s past health information/informatics research has focused on 
the areas of providing cost-effective telemedicine consultation for diabetic and 
other patients; the role of the clinical medical librarian--now emerging as the 
informationist, who provides evidence-based instruction and consultation for 
both clinical providers and consumers; the emergence of public health 
informatics; and unconscious cognition in the genesis of reference queries.</p>  

<p>His current research involves exploration of Nobel laureate discovery patterns 
in physiology and medicine and the potential acceleration of discovery therein; 
the comparative performance of evidence-based medicine aggregator capabilities 
of different search engines--specifically SUMSearch, PubMed and Google 
Scholar--as a joint effort with Robert Badgett, professor of internal medicine 
and chief of medical informatics at UTHSCSA and inventor of SUMSearch; and 
discovery patterns in bio-gerontology, possibly in collaboration with the

<h2>Bill Lukenbill and Barbara Immroth</h2>
<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=35">Bill Lukenbill</a> and <a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=41">Barbara Immroth</a> are collaborating on research and publications that address the health needs of youth. Lukenbill's interest in 
health related topics extends to his research resulting in several published 
works on HIV-AIDS including <em>AIDS-HIV Information Services</em> and <em>Programs in 
Libraries</em> (Englewood, Colorado: Libraries Unlimited, 1994). Lukenbill and 
Immroth's current research and published works include the book <em>Health 
Information for Youth: The Public Library and School Library Media Center 
Role</em> (Westport, Conn: Libraries Unlimited, 2007) and the forthcoming 
book <em>Health Education Across the Curriculum</em> (Libraries Unlimited, 2010).</p>

<p>In 2006-2007 Immroth and Lukenbill received a School of Information Teaching 
Fellowship for a research project "Public and School Librarians as Health 
Information Gatekeepers for Youth in Small Towns and Rural Areas in South 
Texas", which funded a Delphi study of those librarians, resulting in the paper 
"School and Public Youth Librarians as Health Information Gatekeepers:  Research 
from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas," in <em>School Library Media 
Research</em> (2009). Immroth presented a paper written with Lukenbill "The Rio 
Grande Valley of Texas: Issues and Models for Health Information for Youth" at 
the 73rd IFLA General Conference and Council, Durban, South Africa, August 26, 
2007. At the 2009 75th IFLA Conference in Milan, Italy, they presented <em>Get HIP: 
Providing Health Care Information for Youth through Collaboration and 
Team-Building.</em> They also presented a paper on health information in the school 
curriculum at the International Association of School Librarians, Padua, Italy, 
August 2009. (available in the published proceedings of IASL)</p>

<p>In recent years 
they have been collaborating with the Outreach Office of the Library, University 
of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio in developing conferences in order 
to educate school librarians to work with teachers, nurses, counselors and other 
school personnel to better meet the goals of "Coordinated School Health Program 
(CSHP)" established by the Centers for Disease Control, designed to encourage 
schools to become more involved in improving the health of youth in school. The 
first conference based on the CDC model was presented in San Antonio, Texas on 
June 3, 2008. A similar conference is being planned for April 2010. Plans are to 
continue such presentations at local levels throughout the state and nation.</p>

 

<h2>Loriene Roy</h2>
<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=33">Loriene Roy</a> entered the field of librarianship from a previous career as a 
board certified Medical Radiologic Technologist. More recently, she launched a 
Workplace Wellness initiative during her service as the 2007-2008 President of 
the American Library Association. This initiative included a survey sponsored by 
the ALA-APA, providing benchmark figures for the status of Wellness support in 
public, academic, school, and special libraries.  88.8 percent of the 2,147 
respondents indicated that their work environments supported some wellness 
initiative such as employee assistance plans, flu shots, or wellness classes. In 
addition to workplace wellness, writes about indigenous lifeways, including 
Native language recovery, cultural heritage initiatives, and the impact of

<h2><a name="digital">DIGITAL LIBRARIES</a></h2><!-- page_title -->


<!-- ####################### BEGIN PAGE CONTENT ####################### -->



<p>Digital libraries are widely recognized as strategic for the future of the global information environment. By making digital resources available over computer networks, they enable previously unreachable audiences to access vital information and services. As a result, countries around the world consider digital libraries of national interest. In its report <a href="http://www.nitrd.gov/Pubs/pitac/pitac-dl-9feb01.pdf" title="Digital Libraries: Universal Access to Human Knowledge">Digital Libraries: Universal Access to Human Knowledge (pdf)</a>, the U.S. President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) stated that digital libraries have a "profound relevance ... to advancing quality education in every school, learning center, and home in the country." U.S. federal and state institutions have established various research programs in digital libraries such as the Library of Congress' <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/" title="Digital Preservation (Library of Congress)">National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program</a>, and the <a href="http://nsdl.org/" title="NSDL.org - The National Science Digital Library">National Science Foundation's National Science Digital Library</a>. The School of Information at UT is a leader in the field of digital libraries. Approximately one third of the faculty is conducting fundamental research in this field, promoting the creation and study of novel social and technological solutions, and bolstering the broader goal of improving and advancing the quality of research and education both nationally and globally. 
</p>

<p>Research in digital libraries is a multi-disciplinary endeavor that requires knowledge of multiple academic disciplines and technologies. The faculty at the School of Information at UT includes experts in the key areas and technologies required for advancing the state of the art of digital libraries including, among others, process-based and spatial hypermedia systems, multimedia and new media artifacts, electronic document modeling and publication, computer-human interaction, user studies, information retrieval, collaborative systems, and digital preservation. The faculty publishes in the top  academic venues, receives external funding from prestigious institutions such as the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), and organized the premier international conference ACM/ <a href="http://www.jcdl2009.org/" title="JCDL 2009 | Preserving the past, designing the future--today.">IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) in 2009</a>.

<h2>Luis Francisco-Revilla's</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=91">Luis Francisco-Revilla's</a> work on digital libraries has focused on studying and improving the delivery, presentation, adaptation, management, use, and analysis of information. In particular, he has investigated topics such as: how to present information in ways that match the users' needs, activities, and context such that people can understand it and use it effectively; how to manage digital collections containing links to materials held by third parties; and how to seamlessly integrate digital and physical libraries. His research activities include: studying people's work practices to identify patterns of behavior, challenges, and opportunities; designing solutions that solve existing challenges or open new possibilities for people to use and interact with information; and building systems to evaluate and study alternative designs and solutions in real contexts of use, as well as to discover new work practices and research directions. As a co-director of the IMLS-funded Cultivating Digital Librarianship Faculty (CDLF) program -a research-intensive Ph.D. program- Dr. Francisco-Revilla is helping shape tomorrow's leaders in digital libraries research. He is an active member of the international research community, contributing articles and helping in the organization and review process of international conferences and journals. Dr. Francisco-Revilla served as Program Co-Chair of the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) in 2009.

<h2>Lynn Westbrook's</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=73">Lynn Westbrook's</a> work centers on meeting the complex needs of individuals facing personal crises.  Her goal is to use digital libraries to strengthen experts' interventions and participant information-interaction infrastructure.  Her expert intervention foci include: 1) the use of boundary objects to facilitate resource identification, 2) the use of critical thinking interactions to support participants' movement through processes outside of their knowledge domains, and 3) decision support structures in small world contexts.  Her information-interaction work analyzes fluid, developing information nexus points in contextually and temporally situated conditions.  Integrating these two library fundamentals in a digital library involves policy decisions, power dynamics among community user groups, and technology needs of low-resource communities.   The interactions of formal agency, informal community, and individual experience are particularly intense in the often-hidden communities of personal crisis.  Her current research, funded by IMLS, develops library programming and evaluation tools for serving domestic violence survivors and their support networks.

<h2>Lecia Barker's</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=129">Lecia Barker's</a> work in digital libraries has focused on understanding and supporting users' habits and needs for finding educational resources. As co-principal investigator of the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/library/index.jsp" title="Digital Library for Earth System Education">Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE)</a> Evaluation Core Service Center, Dr. Barker conducted several studies on different aspects of the usefulness of DLESE as an educational resource for science teachers, science faculty, and informal educators. For example, she conducted two observation- and interview-based studies that focused on how science teachers search for educational resources and the enablers and barriers to integrating them into their classrooms. The results of these studies were integrated into a large survey sent out to science teachers all over the United States (and a handful of other countries). Dr. Barker also evaluated DLESE outreach and educational projects, such as the DLESE Ambassadors Program, the DLESE Teaching Boxes, and teachers' and librarians' awareness and use of DLESE. Using survey methods, she increased understanding of why unidentified users came to DLESE. She also co-developed the DLESE Evaluation Toolkit and conducted several workshops on evaluation to build capacity for "do-it-yourself" evaluation.  Today, Dr. Barker is principal investigator of the <a href="http://www.bpcportal.org/bpc/shared/home.jhtml;jsessionid=WLDE4IO45OIANABAVRSSFEQ?_requestid=25057" title="Broadening Participation in Computing">Broadening Participation in Computing Collection</a> of the <a href="http://www.engineeringpathway.com/ep/" title="K-Gray Engineering Pathway Digital Library - Engineering Education Wing of the NSDL">Engineering Pathway Digital Library</a>.  The goal of the "BPC Collection" is to enable educators at all levels to easily and quickly identify, select, and use educational resources shown by research to be effective for increasing the participation of members of under-represented groups in information technology careers. Dr. Barker is presently studying the possibility of using a journal-like reviewer service to ensure that the collection's special sub-collections, "Key Research" and "Promising Practices," contain research-based resources. She has also initiated a study to discover whether library users can tacitly learn conceptual knowledge based on the selection of prominent browse terms. Both DLESE and the BPC Collection are funded by the NSF.

<h2>Megan Winget</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=98">Megan Winget</a> is primarily interested in the act of collecting and providing access to complex new media artifacts like digital art, videogames, and scientific data sets. Her interests lie in building models to describe these materials for meaningful retrieval and access, and to represent the context of their creation and use for more robust models of preservation. Because Dr. Winget's work focuses on representation and curation issues, her research scope is broad, and spans the digital libraries, archives, digital preservation and new media communities. Dr. Winget is currently working on an IMLS-funded early career grant to examine issues related to <a href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~megan/Games/" title="Preserving Video Games - IMLS funded research at UT  Austin">videogame preservation</a>.  The primary goal of this research project is to come to a better understanding of the video game industry's creation methods, behaviors, and attitudes for the purpose of building more meaningful models of preservation and collection of these materials. Most of the current preservation projects for new media and video games focus on the end products: the "final" art objects or the released video games themselves. Within the archival community, however, there is the realization that digital preservation starts with creation; it is impossible to reliably and authentically preserve an object without having a very good idea of the circumstances and particulars of that object's creation. This project team (comprised of faculty and students) hopes to shed light on those conditions. The products of this research project will support better collection, access, and preservation of these cultural artifacts. Dr. Winget also teaches a course in <a href="http://courses.ischool.utexas.edu/megan/2009/Fall/INF385T/readings.php" title="UT School of Information - INF 385T :: Digital Curation : Readings">digital curation</a>, which covers issues related to collection development and data acquisition, representation, organization, access, and preservation of "very large digital libraries," of both scientific and humanities data. Dr. Winget co-chaired the Doctoral Consortium at the Joint Conference in Digital Libraries (JCDL) in 2009.

<h2>Unmil Karadkar's</h2>

<p><a href="/people/person_details.php?PersonID=154">Unmil Karadkar's</a> research in digital libraries explores the issues involved in designing digital collections and user interfaces that support individuals and groups in performing specific tasks. He is interested in employing the rapidly emerging mobile technologies to aid people in accomplishing significant educational and scholarly tasks. In particular, his research focuses on how to adapt information content within the constraints imposed by different devices (such as iPhone, desktop computers, or large-screen displays) while maintaining the integrity of the information from a human perceptual standpoint. His approach is intrinsically multi-disciplinary and collaborative, as he continuously works with scholars and students from a wide range of disciplines, including humanities, art, sciences, and education. His projects in digital libraries include the Multi-device Integrated Dynamic Activity Spaces (MIDAS)--an architecture that retains the informational value of digital collections regardless of the diversity in access device characteristics, the Picasso project--enhancing a collection of Picasso's art for use in scholarly and educational settings, and eBat--a digital library of cardio-vascular images of bats, for training life science researchers.
