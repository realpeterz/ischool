<h2>iSchool Research Events</h2>

<p>Fostering an open exchange of ideas with exposure to cutting-edge research engenders a thriving community of scholars and promotes graduate student <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/prospective/excellence.html">excellence</a> by exposing students to the latest knowledge and findings needed to lead the information profession of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>The UT Austin School of Information (iSchool) cultivates such exchange by hosting a variety of recurring and special-event research colloquium.  A regular research colloquium is held during the academic year on every Tuesday except the first of each month. A new <a href="http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/yahoo-series/">Yahoo!-sponsored seminar series</a> brings additional speakers in technology-related areas to speak at the iSchool. A variety of special-event research talks also occur as faculty host visiting researchers from around the world.</p>

<p>These events are open to all, and all are invited to participate: faculty, students, and the public at large. Please visit this page often and feel free to invite your colleagues and friends. To suggest speakers or topics for inclusion in our series, please contact the <a href="mailto:research_environment@utlists.utexas.edu">Research Environment Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br />
 <br />
While information systems researchers have argued well from socio?technical and organizational culture perspectives that information technology (IT) and organizational structures are interdependent and continually reshape each other, few studies have sought fine?grained, micro?level explanations for the heterogeneity in IT use often observed across seemingly similar end users and seemingly similar work contexts. Using a nested comparative case study design, I explore electronic health record (EHR) use by physicians in an integrated multi?specialty health care organization. I use multiple methods to observe and develop micro?level understandings of factors associated with EHR use. The study was conducted in eight practices operating within the same organization. Data collection methods included semi?structured interviews and non?participant observations. A constant comparative approach guided data analysis. Differences in physician values were noted, as were differences in physician perspectives of uncertainty. I categorized physicians as high, medium and low EHR users depending on a variety of factors including degree to which the EHR was integrated into work practices, degree of feature use, and degree of EHR?enabled communication. Drawing on theories of professionalism, I explain between physician heterogeneity in EHR use as partly a function of differences in dimensionality of professional values. Three dimensions of professional values were identified 1) profession oriented, 2) patient?oriented and 3) organization-oriented. Drawing on complexity theory, I argue that differences in physician perspectives of uncertainty influence their EHR use. I found that physicians who viewed uncertainty primarily as reducible through information tended to be higher users of the EHR. Physicians who viewed uncertainty as fundamental, or inherent, in care delivery processes tended to be lower users of the EHR. This study contributes to information systems research by extending current understandings of IT use. The professional values held by physicians and their perspectives of uncertainty may be more important in shaping EHR use than previously thought. These findings indicate the need to more aggressively pursue EHR designs, implementation strategies and policies that accommodate these two additional factors. Additionally, findings from this research indicate a need for IT managers in professional settings to consider end?user professional values and perspectives of uncertainty in decisions involving IT assets.<br />

Holly Lanham, PhD, MBA, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, an Investigator at the Veterans Evidence Based Research Dissemination and Implementation Center at the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, and a Visiting Scholar at the McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin.  Holly researches topics at the intersection of information technology and human behavior.  Her primary research interest is in understanding behavioral and social issues of information technology use.  Her current work examines between-physician differences in electronic health record (EHR) use and is an in-depth investigation of how physicians? values and perspectives on uncertainty are associated with their use of EHRs.</p>

Talk Title: Computing for Creativity and Cooperation<br />

<br />
Talk Abstract:<br />
<br />
The Interface Ecology Lab imagines and develops integral and sensitive human-centered computing to amplify individual and distributed cognition, supporting creativity and cooperation. Through iterative design, we develop the combinFormation information composition platform, games for teaching team coordination, embodied interaction modalities, methods for evaluation, and Support for Information Mapping in Programming Languages (S.IM.PL). The typical search interface is great for finding a single element of information, but weak for information discovery tasks, in which the human goal is to to develop ideas with support and stimulus from search. The combinFormation platform reconceptualizes information discovery support as mixed-initiative information composition, integrating browse-search-collect-and-organize, while representing each collection as a connected whole. To validate composition, information discovery metrics and grounded theory are extended and synthesized, developing formative and summative evaluation methodologies. Games for teaching team coordination connect firefighting practice, game mechanics, and wearable computing. Low cost non-mimetic simulation is found to engage participants in cooperation like firefighting. Embodied interaction involves the human in computing by engaging the senses as the physical world does. The S.IM.PL project develops new declarative mark-up languages integrated with extensions to imperative programming languages (e.g., Java, Objective C, ...), and communications frameworks, to assist developers traversing the divide between information and software.<br />
